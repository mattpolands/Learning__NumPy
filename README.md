# Learning__NumPy

My goal is to record my notes and learning process as it relates to NumPy. Please find attached notebooks that show a record of my notes, my thought process, my practice, and my projects.

Once again I have to thank Pierian Training for its excellent tutorials. I cannot recommend them enough. Cost effective, clear, and concise and where I believe that they truly thrive is at the level of detail they offer (perfect for beginners like myself).

Note on NumPy:
NumPy (Numerical Python) is a powerful Python library for numerical computing. It provides high-performance multidimensional array objects, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently. NumPy is a fundamental library in the scientific Python ecosystem and is extensively used in various fields such as data analysis, machine learning, scientific research, and more.

Key features of NumPy include:
-ndarray: NumPy's main object is the ndarray (n-dimensional array), which is a homogeneous, multidimensional container for elements of the same data type. It allows efficient storage, manipulation, and computation on large arrays of data.
-Vectorized Operations: NumPy provides a wide range of mathematical functions that can be applied directly to arrays, known as vectorized operations. These operations are highly optimized and perform element-wise computations, eliminating the need for explicit loops and improving computational efficiency.
-Broadcasting: NumPy enables broadcasting, which allows arrays of different shapes to be used in operations. Broadcasting automatically applies element-wise operations on arrays with different dimensions, making it convenient to work with arrays of different sizes.
-Array Manipulation: NumPy provides functions to reshape, concatenate, split, and transpose arrays, allowing for flexible manipulation and rearrangement of data.
-Mathematical Functions: NumPy offers a comprehensive set of mathematical functions for various operations such as trigonometry, logarithms, exponentials, statistical computations, linear algebra, and more.
-Integration with Other Libraries: NumPy integrates well with other libraries in the scientific Python ecosystem, such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and SciPy. It serves as the foundation for these libraries, enabling seamless data manipulation, visualization, and scientific computing workflows.

Example of the usage of NumPy:
import numpy as np

*# Create a NumPy array*
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

*# Perform element-wise computation
result = arr * 2

print(result)  

*# Output: [2 4 6 8 10]

In this example, a NumPy array arr is created, and a scalar value of 2 is multiplied to each element of the array using a vectorized operation. The result is a new array result where each element is multiplied by 2.

NumPy's efficient handling of large arrays, vectorized operations, and mathematical functions make it an essential tool for numerical computations and data analysis in Python.
